# About this project

This started off as a silly project that hopes to prove some regions in Auckland get more water outages than others. (I swear I don't live that rurally!)

This is a WIP dashboard built with Hugo (static site generator) and Vue.js (CDN). There is no live version at the moment, but will be added here when completed.

API: https://github.com/axkeyz/water-api

## Quickstart

My Google API key is restricted to https://aileenhuang.dev and http://localhost:5403, so if you want to run it locally, then you may wish to run the following command.

`hugo serve --port=5403 --noHTTPCache`

This also currently uses a testing API hosted @ http://localhost:1899 and will be replaced in the future.
